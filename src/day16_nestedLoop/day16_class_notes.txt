                    username: Cydeo
                    password: Cydeo123

        Ask the user to enter their credentials. 
                If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in." 
                
                If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow
                the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials

                if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is lucked."
